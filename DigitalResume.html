                        <p><br>Originally, my focus was not on the computer world. I liked biological sciences.
                          However, the school system in high school did not suit me and my grades dropped, preventing me from achieving this dream. Despite everything, I got my Scientific Baccalaureate. <br>
                          <br>But during those same years, I also had the opportunity to discover the world of computing. It started with HTML in high school. 
                          Then the C language, python or even JAVA when I decided to take a double degree in biology and computer science at university.<br>
                        <br> Subsequently, I started a masterâ€™s degree in biology because neurology had always attracted me. But my personal life prevented me from going through the course and I felt it was time to take a break.
                        So for two years, I worked as a cashier in a gambling room.
                        And when I felt ready to resume my studies, I got to know EPITECH where I started my pre-msc training in September 2024.<br> <br>
                        And here I am! more determined than ever to take control of my life and offer myself a future in which I will flourish.
                        This makes me a young woman who is motivated to succeed and eager to learn the basics on which my life will be built.<br>
                        To this end, I chose apprenticeship training to be best prepared for the world of work in the field of computer science.<br><br>
                        I am coming dear future and I will work hard so that you are up to my expectations.<br></p>
